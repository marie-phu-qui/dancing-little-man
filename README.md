# Dancing-little-man

Our character lives a difficult life. He has a condition...
If he hears music, he will soon get into one of his dancing transes, while this happens he is incontrollable.
He breaks things around him, loses his reputation and maybe even KILL SOMEONE,
But... if he decides to wear ear plugs he will slowly begin to dive into depression. Depression makes him less able to interract with other people, and more prone to be attrated to the forest (where our respawn point will be set if our character hits a level of depression)
Spending too much time in the lonely forest will arise inner deamons, and with them dangers of suicide temptation.

This is a difficult balance to live a good life, but he sure would like to.
Help him make the right choices.
